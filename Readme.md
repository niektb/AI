Age of Empires 2 AI
===================

AI.txt is an empty file.
The `.ai` files are required for the game
The `.per` files are the actual AI scripts

There are currently two very similar AI script avaibable:
* General Niek
* Atilla

The `Defaults/` directory contains some basic procedures that can be imported by other scripts.
