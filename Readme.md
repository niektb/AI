Age of Empires 2 AI
===================

AI.txt is an empty file.
The `.ai` files are required for the game to find the scripts.
The `.per` files are the actual AI scripts.

There are currently two very similar AI scripts available:
* General Niek
* Atilla

The `Defaults/` directory contains some basic procedures that can be imported by other scripts.
